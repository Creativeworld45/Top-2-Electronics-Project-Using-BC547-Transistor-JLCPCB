In this project, we are going to tech you making top 2 electronics project using led, resistor, capacitor, BC547 transistor & other electronics component. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project no – 1 
Project name : led flasher with BC547 & DC 12v 
Component list : 
1. Transistor – BC547 
2. Resistor – 100 Ω, 1 kΩ
3. Capacitor – 100µf/16v 470µf/16v 
4. Led – RGB, green, blue 
5. Power source – DC-12v 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Transistor pinout – there are two type transistor. One is NPN & the other one is PNP. All transistor contain 3 legs. These 3 legs have different name. For BC547 transistor from left side 1no collector, 2no base & 3no emitter.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project no – 1 (waking process)
Connect 470µf/16v capacitor positive leg with emitter of transistor & connect 100µf/16v capacitor negative leg with emitter of BC547 transistor. Now connect blue color led negative leg with 470µf/16v capacitor negative leg & connect led positive leg with 100µf/16v capacitor positive leg. Now we connect green color led positive leg with collector of transistor .
Now we connect 100Ω resistor. Connect 100Ω resistor with negative led of green color led and connect other terminal with 470µf/16v capacitor negative leg.
It is the time to connect RGB led. Now we connect RGB led negative leg with base of transistor and connect led positive leg with emitter of transistor. 
Now we connect 1 KΩ Resistor. Connect 1 KΩ Resistor with emitter of transistor. 
80% connection for 1st circuit is ready. Now we connect power source. For power source we are using DC -12v power supply. 
Connect DC-12v positive cable with 1 KΩ Resistor & connect DC-12v negative cable with negative leg of Green color led light.

Now Just Plug in the power of DC-12v power supply & enjoy the amazing effect of this led light circuit.

4. Capacitor – 2.2µf/50v, 470µf/25v 
5. Power source – DC-15v 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project no – 2 (making process)
1st we connect 2.2µf/50v capacitor negative leg with base of transistor & connect capacitor positive leg with emitter of transistor. Now we connect 470µf/25v capacitor positive leg with emitter of transistor. 
Now we connect 5mm led light. Connect led light positive leg with collector of transistor and connect led light negative leg with 470µf/25v capacitor negative leg. Now connect 1 KΩ Resistor.  Connect 1 KΩ Resistor with emitter of transistor.
80% connection for 2nd  circuit is ready. Now we connect power source. For power source we are using DC-15v  power supply.
Connect DC-15v positive cable with 1 KΩ Resistor & connect DC-15v negative cable with 470µf/25v capacitor negative leg. 
Now Just Plug in the power of DC-15v power supply & enjoy the amazing effect of this led light circuit.
